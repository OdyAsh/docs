## Ansari v3: Available on Four Platforms

Six months after our v2 release, we've expanded Ansari to be available wherever you need it:

* **Web**: [ansari.chat](https://ansari.chat)  
* **WhatsApp**: [\+1 650 656 3971](https://wa.me/16506563971)  
* **Android**: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.ansari.app&pcampaignid=web_share)  
* **iOS**: [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ansari-chat/id6743072108)

Across Web, iOS and Android, your chat history is preserved when you are logged in.

## User Experience Improvements

In addition to the wider platform availability, we've made several improvements to enhance daily interactions with Ansari:

* **Reduced Hallucinations**: The Claude 3.7 Sonnet \+ RAG system provides more accurate, grounded responses  
* **Improved Citations**: More precise references to Quran, Hadith, and scholarly sources  
* **Tafsir Encyclopedia Integration**: Access to detailed Quranic interpretations through our collaboration with the Usul.ai team  
* **Responsive Design**: Improved experience across screen sizes  
* **Mobile Optimization**: Better keyboard handling and text input

## Behind the Scenes

While some of the improvements are user visible, behind the scenes we've been making changes to improve how the system works. Many of Ansari v3's most significant improvements are in the underlying technology. A reminder that we are open source, and that both the [frontend](https://github.com/ansari-chat/ansari-frontend) and the [backend](https://github.com/ansari-chat/ansari-backend) are available as open source on GitHub.

* **MongoDB Implementation**: Moved from SQL to MongoDB for better handling of complex messaging  
* **Enhanced Search Tools**: Added Tafsir Encyclopedia and Usul.ai integration  
* **React Native Framework**: Rebuilt interface for cross-platform support  
* **Improved CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment processes for faster, more reliable releases  
* **Containerized Infrastructure**: Docker implementation for consistent development and production environments

## Recognition and Gratitude

This release would not have been possible without the contributions of several individuals and partners:

**Amr Mohamed** has contributed significantly to our backend infrastructure and mobile applications. His work implementing MongoDB migration has given us a more flexible database architecture. Amr has led our error tracking and monitoring initiatives through Sentry integration, improving system reliability. He developed and enhanced our citation handling to ensure accurate references to Islamic sources. Additionally, Amr contributed to mobile development, security improvements, and AWS production infrastructure. Without his contributions, Ansari 3 would not have happened on this timeline.

**Ashraf Haress** has played a key role in our backend development, particularly with the WhatsApp integration and codebase improvements. He implemented crucial aspects of the WhatsApp messaging platform support, including markdown conversion and language direction detection. Ashraf's extensive refactoring work has unified our database architecture to support multiple platforms consistently. His contributions to middleware logging, database schema simplification, and environment variable management have significantly improved our development process and system maintainability.

**Abdullah Nahhas** has contributed to several important aspects of our API and code quality. He developed the workflow execution system that provides a more structured approach to processing user queries. Abdullah has also improved our authentication security with thread ownership checks and token handling enhancements. His implementation of code quality tools like Ruff has significantly improved our development process. 

We're grateful to **Amin Ahmad**, whose advisory role has guided our strategic and technical decisions. Amin's insights on AI capabilities, Islamic knowledge representation, and user experience have been valuable in shaping Ansari.

Special thanks to the **Usul.ai team**, particularly **Abdellatif Abdelfattah**, for their partnership. Abdellatif's expertise in Islamic knowledge systems has enhanced Ansari's capabilities. The Tafsir Encyclopedia integration is a result of our collaboration with Abdellatif and the Usul.ai team, providing access to Quranic interpretations and commentary.

We thank these individuals and all our contributors who have made Ansari v3 possible. Above all, we thank Allah SWT for blessing us with the opportunity to serve the ummah through this work.
