This is clearly stated in the hadith narrated by Abu Juhaifa where \"Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) prohibited taking money for blood, the price of a dog, and the earnings of a slave-girl by prostitution; he cursed her who tattoos and her who gets tattooed...\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[2]</sup> This prohibition is further reinforced in another authentic hadith from Ibn 'Umar that \"the Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed the woman who does hair extensions and the one who has that done, and the woman who does tattoos and the one who has that done.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[3]</sup> Additionally, Abdullah reported that \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) cursed the women who do tattoos, those who have their teeth separated and Al-Mutanammisat who change the creation of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.\" This connects the prohibition of tattoos with the concept of changing Allah's creation.</p>\n<p> <sup>[4]</sup> The majority of Islamic jurists (jumhur al-fuqaha) have ruled that tattoos are haram (prohibited) based on these authentic hadiths that curse both the one who applies tattoos and the one who receives them.

The verse states that \"Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted \u02f9to the faith\u02fa, for \u02f9freeing\u02fa slaves, for those in debt, for Allah's cause, and for \u02f9needy\u02fa travellers. \u02f9This is\u02fa an obligation from Allah.

By Allah, I would fight against them even to secure the cord (used for hobbling the feet of a camel) which they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (as zakat) but now they have withheld it.\" This shows that withholding Zakat was considered so serious that it warranted military action to enforce it.</p>\n<p> <sup>[5]</sup> In a letter written by Abu Bakr and stamped with the seal of the Messenger of Allah, Zakat is explicitly described as \"the obligatory sadaqah(zakat) which the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) imposed on Muslims which Allah commanded his Prophet(\ufdfa) to impose.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Obligatory</p>\n<p>I reached this conclusion based on multiple authentic hadiths that clearly establish Zakat as one of the five pillars of Islam, making it an obligatory act of worship.

The Quran explicitly condemns the homosexual acts of the people of Lot (Lut). In Surah Al-A'raf (7:80-81), Prophet Lot addresses his people saying: \"Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before?\" This refers to homosexual acts as an unprecedented immoral act.</p>\n<p>2. In Surah Al-A'raf (6:151) and other verses, Allah mentions prohibitions, stating: \"Do not come near indecencies (fawahish), openly or secretly.\" Classical scholars have included homosexual acts under the category of \"indecencies\" (fawahish).</p>\n<p>3. The story of the people of Lot is mentioned multiple times in the Quran (in Surahs 7, 26, 27, 29) where their practice of homosexual acts is described as \"shameful\" and led to divine punishment.</p>\n<p>4. While the Quran doesn't explicitly mention a specific worldly punishment for homosexual acts, authentic hadiths address this matter. According to scholarly consensus based on these texts, homosexual acts fall under the category of major sins in Islam.</p>\n<p>5. The prohibition applies to the act itself, not to individuals experiencing same-sex attraction. Islamic ethics distinguishes between having certain inclinations and acting upon them.</p>\n<p>The consensus among all major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali) is that homosexual acts are categorically prohibited. This position has been maintained throughout Islamic history and represents the mainstream Islamic position on this issue.</p>\n<p>I reached the tool usage limit during my research, but the evidence gathered from the Quran and hadith collections clearly establishes that homosexual acts are prohibited in Islam.</p>\n"}, {"question": "What is the status of men wearing silk in Islam if there's no reason?

As for the Quran, it says: \"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.

In Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90), Allah states: \"Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions are all evil of Satan's handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[2]</sup> The prohibition is further emphasized in the following verse (5:91) which explains the harmful effects of gambling: \"Satan's plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain?\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[3]</sup> In Surah Al-Baqarah (2:219), Allah acknowledges that while there might be some benefit in gambling, the harm outweighs any potential benefit: \"They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, 'There is great evil in both, as well as some benefit for people\u2014but the evil outweighs the benefit.'\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[4]</sup> The Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence confirms that \"the jurists unanimously agreed on the prohibition of gambling (maisir al-qimar).\" The Shafi'i scholars specifically classified it as \"a major sin among major sins\" when it involves wagering money where the winner takes all.</p>\n<p> <sup>[5]</sup> The prohibition of gambling was revealed gradually, similar to the prohibition of alcohol. In an authentic hadith narrated by Umar ibn al-Khattab in Sunan Abu Dawud, we see that when the verse about gambling was revealed, Umar sought further clarification from Allah.

This is supported by several key references:</p>\n<p>1. In the Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence, it is explicitly stated that Muharram is the first month of the lunar year. As mentioned in document 21: \"\u0648\u064a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0647\u0648 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645... \u0648\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0629\" which translates to \"It is recommended that this month of the year be the month of Muharram... because it is the first month of the lunar year\" (21-4).</p>\n<p>2. The hadith narrated by Abu Bakra in Sahih Muslim confirms the Islamic calendar structure, mentioning Muharram as one of the sacred months. The Prophet \ufdfa stated: \"The year is constituted of twelve months, of which four are sacred; three of them consecutive, viz. Dhu'l-Qa'da, Dhu'l-Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab\" (32-2, 32-3). The ordering of these months in the hadith, with Muharram following Dhu'l-Hijja, indicates its position as the first month of the year.</p>\n<p>3. Multiple authentic hadiths emphasize the special status of Muharram, with the Prophet \ufdfa calling it \"Allah's month\" (\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647), highlighting its significance as the opening month of the Islamic year. As stated in the hadith: \"The most virtuous fasting after the month of Ramadan is Allah's month Al-Muharram\" (27-1, 29-1, 30-1).</p>\n<p>4. Document 24 mentions Shawwal as following Ramadan in the sequence of lunar months, but does not identify it as the first month of the year (24-4).</p>\n<p>While the Quran mentions various months including Ramadan (7-1) and references the sacred months (8-1), it does not explicitly state which month begins the Islamic calendar.

The hadith collections clearly identify the Khawarij as a distinct group that emerged during the time of Ali ibn Abi Talib, specifically during the conflicts between Ali and Mu'awiyah. As mentioned in the authentic hadith from Muslim, \"Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying: There would be two groups in my Ummah, and there would emerge another group (seceding itself from both of them), and the party nearer to the truth among the two would kill them (the group of the Khawarij)\" (Muslim, Book of Zakat, Hadith 2400).</p>\n<p>2. The term \"Haruri\" was used to refer to the Khawarij, as evidenced in the hadith where Aisha asked a woman, \"Are you a Haruri?\" when the woman asked about making up missed prayers during menstruation. The hadith explicitly states that \"Harura is a place associated with a group of the Khawarij\" (Nesai, Book of Menstruation, Hadith 382).</p>\n<p>3. The Khawarij are historically known to have emerged after the Battle of Siffin (37 AH/657 CE) when they rejected Ali's decision to accept arbitration with Mu'awiyah. This makes them chronologically the first major group to break away from the main body of Muslims.</p>\n<p>4. The hadith from Muslim (Book of Zakat, Hadith 2409) describes their characteristics as stated by Ali ibn Abi Talib: \"They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies.\" This indicates their literal interpretation of religious texts without deeper understanding.</p>\n<p>5. Historical records show that Ali fought against the Khawarij at the Battle of Nahrawan, confirming their early emergence as a distinct faction that opposed mainstream Muslim leadership.</p>\n<p>The other options mentioned (Mutazilis, Shia, and Jahmiyyah) all emerged later in Islamic history. The Shia gradually developed as a distinct identity after the death of Ali, the Mutazilis emerged in the early 2nd century AH as a theological school, and the Jahmiyyah appeared even later, founded by Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 128 AH/746 CE).</p>\n<p>I reached the tool usage limit, but the evidence gathered from authentic hadith collections clearly supports that the Khawarij were the first major group to break away from mainstream Islam.</p>\n"}, {"question": "In whose reign was the current Islamic Calendar created?", "options": ["Abu Bakr", "Umar", "Uthmaan", "Ali"], "correct": "Umar", "category": "Islamic History", "explanation": "<p>I'll help you answer this question about the Islamic calendar by searching for relevant information from Islamic sources.I need to search for more specific information about the Islamic calendar's creation.I need to search for more specific information about the Islamic calendar's creation.Based on the hadith references I've reviewed, I can determine the answer to the question about who established the Islamic calendar.</p>\n<p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Umar</p>\n<p>The Islamic calendar (Hijri calendar) was established during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab.

Let there be no change in this creation of Allah. That is the Straight Way, but most people do not know.\" This verse establishes that humans are created with a natural inclination toward goodness and monotheism.</p>\n<p>This concept is further reinforced by numerous authentic hadiths.  <sup>[2]</sup>  <sup>[3]</sup> Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said: \"No child is born but upon Fitra\" and then recited: \"The nature made by Allah in which He created man, there is no altering of Allah's nature; that is the right religion.\" </p>\n<p> <sup>[4]</sup> The Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) also explained: \"No babe is born but upon Fitra.

The Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) explicitly cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men, as reported in several authentic narrations:</p>\n<p> <sup>[1]</sup> Ibn 'Abbas narrated: \"The Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.\" This hadith is graded as Sahih (authentic) and is reported in Abu Dawud.</p>\n<p>The same prohibition is reinforced in multiple other authentic hadith collections:<br> <sup>[2]</sup> It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed men who imitate women and woman who imitate men.</p>\n<p> <sup>[3]</sup> It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.</p>\n<p> <sup>[4]</sup> Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) cursed the women who imitate men and the men who imitate women.\"</p>\n<p>The prohibition extends beyond just clothing to include mannerisms and behavior:<br> <sup>[5]</sup> Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed the effeminate men and those women who assume the similitude (manners) of men. He also said, \"Turn them out of your houses.\" He turned such-and-such person out, and `Umar also turned out such-and-such person.</p>\n<p>The Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence further clarifies this ruling:<br> <sup>[6]</sup> The majority of scholars hold that it is prohibited for women to imitate men and for men to imitate women. Bukhari reported from Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men. Some Shafi'i scholars and a group of Hanbali scholars considered it disliked (makruh) rather than prohibited.</p>\n<p>The prohibition includes various aspects of imitation:<br> <sup>[7]</sup> The imitation occurs in clothing, movements, mannerisms, affectations in body language and voice. Examples include men wearing clothing and adornments specific to women, such as veils, necklaces, chokers, bracelets, anklets, earrings, and other items not permissible for men to wear. Similarly, imitating women in actions specific to them, such as effeminacy in body language and femininity in speech and walking.</p>\n<p>This ruling is based on the Islamic principle of maintaining the distinct nature and roles of men and women as created by Allah. The prohibition of cross dressing is considered a serious matter in Islamic law, as evidenced by the use of the term \"cursed\" in the hadith, which indicates a major sin.</p>\n<p>Therefore, based on these authentic Islamic sources, cross dressing is clearly prohibited in Islam.</p>\n<p><strong>Citations</strong>:<br><sup>[1]</sup> AbuDaud - Chapter 34: Clothing (Kitab Al-Libas), Section 1532:  Women's Clothing, Hadith 3963, LK id 3_34_1532_3963 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br>English: Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.</p>\n<p><sup>[2]</sup> IbnMaja - Chapter 9: The Chapters on Marriage, Section -1: , Hadith 1905, LK id 4_9_-1_1905 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br>English: It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas: that the Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed men who imitate women and woman who imitate men.</p>\n<p><sup>[3]</sup> IbnMaja - Chapter 9: The Chapters on Marriage, Section -1: , Hadith 1904, LK id 4_9_-1_1904 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br>English: It was narrated from Abu Hurairah: that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women.</p>\n<p><sup>[4]</sup> Tirmizi - Chapter 43: Chapters on Manners, Section -1: , Hadith 2901, LK id 6_43_-1_2901 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br>English: Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) cursed the women who imitate men and the men who imitate women.\"</p>\n<p><sup>[5]</sup> Bukhari - Chapter 86: Limits and Punishments set by Allah (Hudood), Section 33: Exiling the sinners and effeminate men, Hadith 6834, LK id 1_86_33_6834 (Grade: Sahih-Authentic):<br>English: Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (\ufdfa) cursed the effeminate men and those women who assume the similitude (manners) ofmen.

provide a definitive answer to the question about the status of Salaat (prayer) in Islam.</p>\n<p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Obligatory</p>\n<p>The evidence from the Quran and authentic hadith clearly establishes that prayer (Salaat) is obligatory in Islam, not merely encouraged or permitted. This is supported by several key pieces of evidence:</p>\n<p> <sup>[1]</sup> The Quran explicitly states in Surah An-Nisa (4:103): \"Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.\" This verse directly establishes prayer as an obligation with specific timeframes.</p>\n<p> <sup>[2]</sup> In a hadith narrated by Mu'adh bin Jabal, the Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) clearly identified prayer as the pillar of Islam, saying: \"The head of the matter is Islam, and its pillar is the Salat, and its hump is Jihad.\" This demonstrates the central and foundational nature of prayer in the Islamic faith.</p>\n<p> <sup>[3]</sup> The distinction between obligatory and voluntary prayers is made clear in another hadith where the Prophet (\ufdfa) said: \"And the most virtuous Salat after the obligatory is the night prayer.\" This statement confirms the existence of obligatory prayers as the primary requirement.</p>\n<p> <sup>[4]</sup> The Prophet (\ufdfa) also emphasized the importance of performing prayer at its appointed time, saying to Abu Dharr: \"There will be leaders after me who cause the Salat to die; so perform the Salat during its time. If you pray (with them) during its time, then that will be voluntary Salat for you, if not, then you will have attained your Salat.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[5]</sup> The Quran further reinforces this obligation in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:238): \"Observe the \u02f9five obligatory\u02fa prayers\u2014especially the middle prayer\u2014and stand in true devotion to Allah.\"</p>\n<p>The obligatory nature of prayer is also evident from its position as one of the five pillars of Islam, which represent the fundamental obligations that every Muslim must fulfill. Classical scholars across all major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali) unanimously agree that the five daily prayers are obligatory (fard) upon every adult Muslim of sound mind.</p>\n<p>I reached the tool usage limit while gathering information, but the evidence collected clearly establishes that prayer in Islam is obligatory, not merely encouraged, permitted, disliked, or prohibited.</p>\n<p><strong>Citations</strong>:<br><sup>[1]</sup> Quran 4:103:<br> Text: Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.</p>\n<p><sup>[2]</sup> Tirmizi - Chapter 40: The Book on Faith, Section 8:  What Has Been Related About The Scaredness Of Salat, Hadith 2723, LK id 6_40_8_2723 (Grade: Hasan - Good):<br> Text: He said: 'The head of the matter is Islam, and its pillar is the Salat, and its hump is Jihad.' </p>\n<p><sup>[3]</sup> Tirmizi - Chapter 2: The Book on Salat (Prayer), Section 207: What Has Been Related About The Virtue Of Salat During The Night, Hadith 439, LK id 6_2_207_439 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br> Text: And the most virtuous Salat after the obligatory is the night prayer.\"</p>\n<p><sup>[4]</sup> Tirmizi - Chapter 2: The Book on Salat (Prayer), Section 15: What Has Been Related About Hastening The Salat When The Imam Delays It, Hadith 176, LK id 6_2_15_176 (Grade: Sahih - Authentic):<br> Text: There will be leaders after me who cause the Salat to die; so perform the Salat during its time.

It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way.\" Pornography involves watching acts of zina (fornication/adultery) and is thus included in the prohibition of approaching anything that leads to such acts.</p>\n<p> <sup>[5]</sup> The Prophet \ufdfa prohibited looking at the private parts of others, stating: \"A man should not look at the private parts of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman.\"  <sup>[6]</sup> This prohibition is reinforced in another authentic hadith where the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"No woman should look at the nakedness of another woman, and no man should look at the nakedness of another man.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[7]</sup> When asked about concealing private parts, the Prophet \ufdfa instructed: \"If it is within your power

Do you want your order to be carried out?

For example, Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet (\ufdfa) forbade the wearing of a gold ring. In another instance, the Prophet (\ufdfa) saw a person wearing a gold signet ring, pulled it off and threw it away.

In another narration, Ali simply stated, \"He forbade red Al-Mayathir, wearing Al-Qassi, and gold rings.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[7]</sup> The Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence clearly states: \"It is prohibited for men to use gold ornaments in all their forms.\" This ruling is based on the general hadith: \"Gold and silk are permitted for the females of my nation and forbidden for its males.\" However, there are two exceptions to this prohibition: The first exception is when there is a necessity. The majority of scholars permit the use of a nose or tooth made of gold when necessary.</p>\n<p> <sup>[8]</sup> The encyclopedia further classifies wearing gold by men among the prohibited (haram) actions, stating: \"Examples of what is prohibited: men imitating women and vice versa in adornment, men adorning themselves with gold and wearing silk except for a valid reason.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[9]</sup> Regarding the ruling for children, the Hanafi and Hanbali schools, as well as one opinion in the Shafi'i school, prohibit males from wearing gold whether they are young or old, except in cases of necessity. The Maliki school permits children to wear gold, though with dislike (karahah). The Shafi'i school, in their most correct opinion, permits it absolutely. In another view, it is permitted before two years of age and prohibited afterward, and this is what Al-Baghawi definitively stated.</p>\n<p>The Quranic verses mentioning gold bracelets (35:33 and 18:31) refer to the adornments of Paradise, not permissible adornments in this world.

The Prophet (\ufdfa) sent Uthman because he was highly respected by the Meccans. While Uthman was in Mecca, rumors spread that he had been killed. In response to this news, the Prophet (\ufdfa) gathered his companions under a tree and they pledged allegiance to him, ready to avenge Uthman's death. During this pledge, the Prophet (\ufdfa) held out his right hand saying, \"This is Uthman's hand,\" and then struck his other hand with it saying, \"This (pledge of allegiance) is on behalf of Uthman.\"</p>\n<p> <sup>[2]</sup> This incident is further confirmed in another narration where Ibn Umar explained that the Prophet (\ufdfa) had sent Uthman to Mecca, and the Ridwan Pledge took place after Uthman had gone there. During this pledge, the Prophet (\ufdfa) raised his right hand saying, \"This is the hand of Uthman,\" and clapped it over his other hand and said, \"This is for Uthman.\"</p>\n<p>The pledge was taken as a commitment to fight and potentially die for the cause, as  <sup>[3]</sup> Salama bin Al-Akwa' stated that they gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) on the day of Al-Hudaibiya \"for death (in the Cause of Islam).\"</p>\n<p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Uthmaan</p>\n<p><strong>Citations</strong>:<br><sup>[1]</sup> Bukhari - Chapter 62: Companions of the Prophet, Section 7: The virtues of 'Uthman bin Affan \u0631\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647, Hadith 3698, LK id 1_62_7_3698 (Grade: Sahih-Authentic):<br> Text: As for his absence fromthe Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than`Uthman (to be sent as a representative).
