## Key points before we go any further

- Ansari is not perfect. It can and will make mistakes. 
- We have gone to some trouble to validate that it does say things that are *mostly* correct. We have reviewed over 2,500 user interactions. Of those questions, we found 9 that we weren't sure were correct or not (mostly on fiqh questions like inheritance etc). We sent those 9 to some religious scholars, and it turned out Ansari was correct on 8 (the one it got wrong was a complex inheritance questions). 
- If you see it say something you're not sure about or wrong, just tell Ansari that you want to flag this (as in "I want to flag this") and a human will review the conversation. Or send e-mail to feedback@ansari.chat. 

## It can answer questions about the Qur'an

Ayah: 31:27
Arabic: وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَـٰمٌ وَٱلْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍۢ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَـٰتُ ٱللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ
English: If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.

User: Give me a point by point summary of the last verse of Surah Al Baqarah

Ansari: The last verse of Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286) is a profound verse that encapsulates several key Islamic beliefs and principles. Here is a point-by-point summary:

Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity: This part of the verse emphasizes that Allah is Just and Merciful, and He does not impose on any soul duties and responsibilities beyond its ability to bear.

Each soul will be rewarded for its good deeds: This part of the verse reinforces the concept of individual responsibility and accountability in Islam. It assures that every good action will be rewarded.

Each soul will bear the consequences of its evil deeds: This part of the verse serves as a warning that individuals will also bear the consequences of their wrong actions.

The verse ends with a supplication to Allah: The believers ask Allah not to burden them as He burdened those before them, not to burden them with more than they can bear, to forgive them, to have mercy on them, and to help them against those who disbelieve.

English: "In the name of Allah, I place my trust in Allah, and there is no might nor power except with Allah."

3. Privacy and modesty: One should ensure privacy and maintain modesty by keeping the body covered as much as possible.

## It can provide answers that covers multiple opinions on modern topics

```text
User: Is music halal or haram?

Ansari: The issue of music in Islam is a complex one and scholars have different opinions.

Imam Al Ghazali in his book "Ihya Ulum al-Din" argued that music in itself is not haram (prohibited), but it becomes so if it leads to 
sinful behavior, such as neglecting one's duties towards Allah or indulging in immoral activities.

On the other hand, Ibn Taymiyah, a prominent scholar of the Hanbali school, held a stricter view. He believed that most music is haram, 
especially if it includes sinful or misleading content.

In the modern era, Sheikh Yusuf Al Qaradawi, in his book "The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam", states that not all music 
is haram. He argues that music is permissible as long as it does not lead to sinful behavior or thoughts, and does not include any haram 
content.

It's important to note that all scholars agree that any form of music that includes haram content (such as promoting immorality, 
sinful behavior, or containing foul language) is prohibited.

As a Muslim, it's important to seek knowledge and make informed decisions based on the Qur'an, Hadith, and the advice of knowledgeable 
scholars.

## It can reassure/console you when you have doubts/worries (with supporting evidence)

```text
User: I have really made many major mistakes. Can Allah still forgive me?

Ansari: Yes, Allah can certainly forgive you. The Qur'an repeatedly emphasizes Allah's boundless mercy and forgiveness.

Ayah: 4:106
Arabic Text: وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا
English Text: And seek Allah’s forgiveness—indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Ayah: 5:74
Arabic Text: أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُۥ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ
English Text: Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

These verses clearly indicate that Allah is All-Forgiving and Most Merciful.
No matter how major your mistakes are, if you sincerely repent and seek His 
forgiveness, Allah can forgive you. It's never too late to turn back to Allah.
```

```text
User: Lots of bad things keep happening to me. Does Allah still love me?

Ansari: Yes, Allah's love for His creation is immense and enduring. Experiencing difficulties or trials does not mean that Allah does not love you. In fact, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a Hadith recorded by Imam Tirmidhi and Imam Ibn Majah: "When Allah loves a servant, He tests him."

Sheikh Salman Al-Awdah, a contemporary scholar, explains that trials can be a means of purification and a way to attain a higher rank in the sight of Allah. They can also serve as a reminder for us to turn back to Allah and strengthen our relationship with Him.

Remember the words of Allah in the Qur'an:

Ayah: 2:286
Arabic Text: لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦ ۖ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ ۚ أَنتَ مَوْلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ
English Text: Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear. Each will enjoy the good they have earned and suffer the evil they have wrought. O our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. O our Lord! Do not burden us as You burdened those before us. O our Lord! Do not impose on us what we do not have the strength to bear. Pardon us, forgive us, have mercy on us. 
You are our Protector, so help us against the disbelieving people.

So, be patient, keep faith in Allah's wisdom and mercy, and remember that every difficulty is an opportunity for growth and spiritual elevation. May Allah ease your difficulties and grant you patience.

User: What is the root word of اتستبدلون

Ansari: The root word of اتستبدلون (Tastabdiloon) is ب-د-ل (B-D-L). 
This root in Arabic carries the basic meaning of changing, substituting, 
or replacing something.

The word اتستبدلون is in the form of the 10th verb form (Istif'al), which often 
conveys the meaning of seeking or asking for the action of the root. So, in this case, 
it would mean "you seek to replace" or "you wish to substitute".

This word is used in the Qur'an in several places, such as in Ayah 2:61 of Surah Al-Baqarah:

Arabic: وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الْأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّائِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا ۖ قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ۚ اهْبِطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ ۗ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا وَّكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ
English: And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. 
So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs 
and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions." [Moses] said, 
"Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and 
indeed, you will have what you have asked." And they were covered with humiliation 
and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they 
[repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. 
That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.

In this context, "أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ" (Atastabdiloon) is translated as "Would you exchange", 
referring to the Israelites' wish to exchange the manna and quails they were provided 
with for the vegetables of the earth.

User: write a short khaatira on the importance of perseverance

Ansari: Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,

Today, let's reflect on the importance of perseverance, a quality 
highly valued in Islam.

Perseverance, or Sabr in Arabic, is often translated as patience, but 
it encompasses much more. It's about resilience, steadfastness, and 
enduring difficulties while remaining faithful to Allah's commands.

Allah says in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153):

Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ
English: O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. 
Indeed, Allah is with the patient.

This verse reminds us that perseverance is not a passive state, but an 
active one. It's about seeking help through patience and prayer, and 
knowing that Allah is with us in our struggles.

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, a great scholar, once said, "Allah has mentioned
 patience in the Qur'an in 90 places."

Perseverance is the key to overcoming challenges. It's the quality that 
helps us maintain our faith during times of hardship and uncertainty. 
It's what allows us to continue doing good, even when it's difficult.

Remember the words of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as r
ecorded in Sahih Bukhari: "The real patience is at the first stroke of a calamity."

So, let's strive to cultivate this quality of perseverance. Let's be 
patient in our trials, steadfast in our prayers, and resilient in our faith. 
For indeed, Allah is with the patient.

May Allah grant us all the strength to persevere through our trials 
and tribulations. Ameen.

Wa Allahu 'Alam (And Allah knows best).

User: Write a brief islamized version of the story of the boy 
who cried wolf.

Ansari: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young boy named Ahmed. 
Ahmed was responsible for looking after his family's flock of sheep. His 
father, a wise and pious man, always reminded him of the importance of 
honesty as taught in our beautiful religion, Islam. He would often quote 
the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) recorded by Imam 
Bukhari and Imam Muslim, "Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and 
righteousness leads to Paradise."

However, Ahmed, being a playful and mischievous boy, thought it would be 
amusing to trick the villagers. One day, he cried out, "Wolf! Wolf!" 
The villagers, hearing his cries, rushed to help him, only to find out 
there was no wolf. Ahmed laughed at their confused and annoyed faces.

He repeated this trick a few times, each time causing distress 
among the villagers. They reminded him of the verse from the Qur'an, Surah 
Al-Baqarah (2:42), "And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal 
the truth while you know [it]."

One day, a wolf really did come. Terrified, Ahmed cried out for help,
"Wolf! Wolf!" But this time, no one came to his aid. They thought it was 
another one of his tricks. The wolf attacked the flock, and Ahmed could 
do nothing but watch in despair.

When his father found out, he reminded Ahmed of the consequences of lying. 
He quoted a Hadith from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, "Beware of lying, 
for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell."

From that day forward, Ahmed learned his lesson. He understood the wisdom 
in the teachings of Islam about truthfulness and honesty. He promised never 
to lie again and grew up to be a truthful and trustworthy man, just as our 
beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known as 
Al-Sadiq (the truthful) and Al-Amin (the trustworthy).

And this story serves as a reminder for us all about the importance of 
honesty and the consequences of lying. May Allah guide us to be among 
the truthful. Ameen.

User: OK now express the above as a poem.

Ansari: 
In a village small and quaint, lived a boy without restraint,
Young Ahmed, shepherd of the flock, against the wolf, he was the block.

His father wise, with faith so deep, told him, "Son, your word you keep,
For truth leads to righteousness, and that to Heaven, no less."

But Ahmed, playful, full of jest, put his villagers to test,
Cried "Wolf! Wolf!" though none was near, laughed at their unfounded fear.

Again he cried, the wolf's attack, but his lies held no fact,
The villagers, with trust now shaken, felt by the boy, they were forsaken.

A verse from the Qur'an they shared, "Mix not truth with falsehood, be not ensnared,
Conceal not truth, while you know," yet Ahmed's antics didn't slow.

Then came the day, the wolf appeared, Ahmed cried out, just as feared,
"Wolf! Wolf!" echoed his plea, but the villagers let it be.

The wolf attacked, the flock was lost, Ahmed now felt the cost,
His father said, "Lying leads to wickedness, and that to Hell's abyss."

Ahmed learned, from that day on, the value of the dawn,
The dawn of truth in one's heart, from which he vowed never to part.

He grew up truthful, trustworthy too, just like the Prophet, our guide so true,
And so we learn, from Ahmed's tale, in truth and honesty, we shall not fail.

May Allah guide us on the path, save us from falsehood's wrath,
Lead us to righteousness, and in the Hereafter, eternal bliss. Ameen.
