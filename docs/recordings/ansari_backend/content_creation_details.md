Related to audio editing:
* Used Descript to edit audio.
* Related to `Audio Effects`:
  * Added `studio sound` with `65%` intensity (free plan contains few tries, so I subscribed to creative plan).
  * Added `low pass filter` with `8913 Hz` cutoff frequency to reduce high frequency noise.
* Removed filler words using Descript's `remove filler words` / `shorten word gaps` features (same free/subscription comment)
